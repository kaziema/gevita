 * D204/F1 -- correct AI_LEN_REG semantics. ROBUSTNESS, not a bug fix:

 *
 * src/audi.c:531 sizes every audio block as
 *     frameSamples = (u16)((g_FrameSize - (osAiGetLength() >> 2) + 16 + 0x25) & ~0xf)
 * clamped below at g_MinFrameSize. On the N64 osAiGetLength() reads
 * AI_LEN_REG: the bytes left in the ONE buffer the DAC is currently playing,
 * bounded by g_MaxFrameSize*4, so the term acts as a +-64-sample trim.
 *
 * Reporting SDL's whole queue depth instead lets that subtraction (done in
 * u32) wrap once the queue exceeds g_FrameSize + 0x35 frames, which it does
 * routinely -- measured high-water 2064 frames over a 5 min run. That wrap
 * is HARMLESS in practice and I verified it rather than assuming: the result
 * is stored into `s16 frameSamples` (audi.c:145), so it lands negative and
 * audi.c's own `(s32)frameSamples < g_MinFrameSize` clamp catches it, giving
 * a nominal 720-sample frame. Max block observed stays 3136 bytes against
 * the 3156-byte info->data allocation -- there is no heap overrun.
 *
 * Bounding the report to one buffer is still the right thing: it matches the
 * hardware the game was written against, keeps the arithmetic inside its
 * designed range instead of relying on a signed-overflow accident, and costs
 * one compare. AGENTS.md rule #2: it belongs here in port/, not in audi.c.
