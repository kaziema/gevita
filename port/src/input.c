/*
 * Input: SDL2 keyboard/mouse/gamepad -> N64 controller state (Phase 3, D118).
 *
 * The game reads controllers via osContStartReadData / osContGetReadData
 * (src/joy.c). libultra.c's SI section calls into this module once per
 * controller poll: inputUpdate() refreshes SDL + accumulates the mouse-aim
 * delta, then inputComputePad() produces the 16-bit button mask + stick for
 * one controller. This is the single source of controller state on PC --
 * the old contSnapshotFromKeyboard() now delegates here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a full port of pd_port/port/src/input.c (1551 lines): GE's
 * menu/config code never calls that module's VK/bind-string API, so this is a
 * focused implementation matching port/include/input.h plus the two helpers
 * libultra.c needs.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BINDING SCHEME (documented in docs/internals.md sec F "D118")
 *
 * GE's default "1.1" control style: analog stick = move/strafe, the four
 * C-buttons = aim/turn/look (DIGITAL on N64), R = aim mode, Z = fire.
 *
 * Keyboard + mouse (controller 0, migrated PC defaults):
 *   W/S/A/D or arrows .. movement / strafe
 *   mouse motion ....... look (mode-aware -- see MOUSE-LOOK below)
 *   left mouse ......... fire; right mouse / LShift .. aim
 *   Q .................. next weapon; E .. dedicated use
 *   R .................. dedicated reload; LCtrl .. independent crouch
 *   Enter / Tab ........ Start
 *
 * Xbox / SDL_GameController (controller 0 merges pad 0 with kbd/mouse;
 * pads 1-3 -> controllers 1-3):
 *   left stick ........ analog stick   (move / strafe)
 *   right stick ....... C-buttons      (digital, 50% threshold -- aim)
 *   right trigger ..... Z trigger      (fire)
 *   left trigger ...... R trigger      (aim mode)
 *   A ................. use/interact (in-game); accept (menus)
 *   X ................. reload (in-game); accept (menus)
 *   B ................. cycle inventory gadgets (in-game); cancel (menus)
 *   Y ................. next weapon (in-game); cancel (menus)
 *   stick clicks ...... crouch (in-game)
 *   LB ................ aim (alternate to LT); RB reserved (no HD assets)
 *   D-pad ............ N64 D-pad
 *   Start ............ Start; Back opens the PC options overlay
 *
 * MOUSE-LOOK (mode-aware, no src/ changes)
 *   GE's aim model (bondview2.c bondviewProcessInput / MoveData) is
 *   mode-dependent, so the mouse->pad mapping is too:
 *
 *   - Hipfire (!insightaimmode): yaw = analog stick-X ("natural turn");
 *     pitch = DIGITAL C-up/C-down (stick-Y here is move fwd/back and does
 *     not pitch). Mouse Y emits a C-button on polls where it moved.
 *   - Aim mode (R / RMB held): yaw AND pitch are analog -- the stick pushed
 *     past +/-60 gives proportional (stick-60)/10 aim speed. Mouse X/Y push
 *     the stick into the 61..80 band. We emit NO C-buttons in this mode
 *     because there they mean crouch / lean / zoom (this was D118c:
 *     aim + look-down -> crouch).
 *
 *   "aim button held" is read from our own RMB/LShift state -- exact for
 *   the default hold-to-aim scheme; a toggle-aim scheme would need a read
 *   of g_CurrentPlayer->insightaimmode (still no logic change).
 *
 *   GE's native pitch is inverted ("flight" style: C-up -> look down). We
 *   hide that: mouse-down looks down by default, MouseInvertY flips it.
 *
 *   Tunable via ge007.ini [Input]: MouseAimSpeed (aim mode), MouseTurnSpeed
 *   (hipfire yaw), MouseInvertY, MouseEnabled. Residual: in hipfire, yaw
 *   (analog) and pitch (digital) still feel different (D118a) -- a fully
 *   analog hipfire pitch needs an #ifdef PORT hook in bondview.c (TODO).

 * (matches D193's measured steady-state sim rate) -- so "px this poll"

/* --- Input.PdMouseAim: the port side of PD's mouse-aim model ----------------
 * See the flag's comment above for the design. PD's own implementation lives
 * in its GAME files (bondmove.c/bondgun.c) behind `#ifndef PLATFORM_N64`, with
 * the port supplying the input; we mirror that with `#ifdef PORT` hooks in
 * GE's aim path (sub_GAME_7F067FBC, gunfire.c).
 *
 * The port accumulates the mouse delta (aimGepdAccumulate, shared with GEPD's
 * model) and the game's own crosshair integrator does the rest. PD's range is
 * swivelpos in [-1,1] == the screen edge, which is what the game's display
 * formula maps to half a screen width; GEPD's crosshair limit is that same
 * edge in its own units, so dividing by it gives PD's units. */
